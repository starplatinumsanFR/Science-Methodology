    "\n",
    "This experiment aims to evaluate the performance of a parallel quicksort implementation in C using Pthreads, compared against its sequential variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to understand:\n",
    "- How the number of threads or array size impacts sorting performance.\n",
    "- At what point parallelism provides a measurable speed-up.\n",
    "- How thread management overhead affects runtime efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests were executed on a machine with an 8-core processor (2.90 GHz) using GCC (pthread) and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook environment for visualization and computation reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "All results and visualizations in this report are generated from code cells executed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All source code below comes from the parallelQuicksort.c file by Joshua Stough and Arnaud Legrand:\n",

    "\n",
    "Below is a sanity test to make sure everything works as intended. As you can see, by default, the sequential is significatively more efficient than its parallel counterpart."

    "After verifying the program’s correctness with a baseline test (`N = 1,000,000`), I extended the analysis to study how parallel quicksort performance scales when varying the array size with larger numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I experimented with increasing array sizes defined by `N = 10,000,000 × i`, where `i` is the iteration number.  \n",
    "At this stage, the number of threads was constant (THREAD_LEVEL = 10).  \n",
    "The results revealed that the sequential quicksort consistently and often narrowly outperformed the parallel version at 10 threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the limitation does not lie in the idea of parallelism itself, but rather in its implementation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To document the first scaling experiment, where I varied the array size while keeping the thread count constant to 10,  \n",
    "the following code snippet outlines the procedure used to collect runtimes and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "First start by running the next cell once, if you encounter an error trying to run any other code that will come after, \n",
    "that will compile the file. Then you may run the code snippet below."
