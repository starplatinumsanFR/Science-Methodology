    "This experiment aims to evaluate the performance of a parallel quicksort implementation in C using Pthreads, compared against its sequential and built-in counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to understand:\n",
    "- How the number of threads (`THREAD_LEVEL`) or array size impacts sorting performance.\n",
    "- At what point parallelism provides a measurable speed-up.\n",
    "- How thread management overhead affects runtime efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests were executed on a machine with an 8-core processor (2.90 GHz) using GCC (pthread) and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook environment for visualization and computation reproducibility.\n",

    "Below is a sanity test to make sure everything works as intended. As you can see, by default, the sequential is significatively more efficient than its parallel counterpart."

    "### Experimental Scaling and Thread-Level Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After verifying the program’s correctness with a baseline test (`N = 1,000,000`), I extended the analysis to study how parallel quicksort performance scales when varying the array size with larger numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I experimented with increasing array sizes defined by `N = 10,000,000 × i`, where `i` is the iteration number.  \n",
    "At this stage, the number of threads was constant (`THREAD_LEVEL = 10`).  \n",
    "The results revealed that the sequential quicksort consistently and often narrowly outperformed the parallel version at 10 threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the limitation does not lie in the idea of parallelism itself, but rather in its implementation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To document the first scaling experiment, where I varied the array size while keeping the thread count constant to 10,  \n",
    "the following code snippet outlines the procedure used to collect runtimes and confidence intervals.\n",
